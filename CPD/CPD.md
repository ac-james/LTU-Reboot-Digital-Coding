CPD activity
Introduction to GitHub, Code Editors and Chrome Development tools.

What have I learnt?

I learnt how to create my profile, how to create a repository, how to fork a repository. I learnt about different code editors and how to start using Visual Studio Code. We also had an intro to Chrome development tools and I learnt how to access these in the Chrome browser.

I created a profile in GitHub, copied the LTU Reboot file onto my desktop and then into GitHub Desktop, forked the LTU Reboot repository on GitHub to add to my own account and used Visual Studio Code to create this CPD and add it to GitHub.

What did I find hard?

Keeping clarity in my mind about the difference between resources and how they interelate to each other e.g. the points at which you would use GitHub vs GitHub desktop and how/when you need to move work from one to the other. I re-watched the relevant part of our lesson today to get greater clarity.
